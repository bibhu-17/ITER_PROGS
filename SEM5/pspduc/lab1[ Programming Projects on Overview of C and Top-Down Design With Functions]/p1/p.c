// PROBLEM
// Write a program to assist in the design of a hydroelectric dam. Prompt the user for the height
//  of the dam and for the number of cubic meters of water that are projected to flow from the top
//  to the bottom of the dam each second. Predict how many megawatts (1MW = 106W) of power
//  will be produced if 90% of the work done on the water by gravity is converted to electrical
//  energy. Note that the mass of one cubic meter of water is 1000 kg. Use 9.80 meters/second2
//  as the gravitational constant g . Be sure to use meaningful names for both the gravitational
//  constant and the 90% efficiency constant. For one run, use a height of 170 m and flow of
//  1.30 Ã— 103 m3/s. The relevant formula ( w = work, m = mass, g = gravity, h = height) is: ws
//  = mgh.

// ANALYSIS
// Function Definition:
// The main() function is defined but incomplete. It should have a return type of int and a proper function signature, such as int main(void) or int main(int argc, char *argv[]).Variable Declarations:
// Variables mass, h, and work are declared as double but the declaration is incomplete and lacks a semicolon (;).Input/Output Operations:
// The printf function prompts the user to "Enter the flow" but the string is incomplete and contains a typo ('Wolf" instead of "Enter the flow:").The scanf function is used to read input but the format specifier and variable are missing or incorrect.Typographical Errors:
// Several typographical errors exist, such as Drintf instead of printf and heieh instead of height.
